#  Black Hole Gravitational Lensing Simulation

A real-time visualization of gravitational lensing around a Schwarzschild black hole, implemented with **React**, **Three.js**, and **GLSL fragment shaders**. This project simulates how light bends in the strong gravitational field of a black hole, producing the iconic "Einstein ring" and warped starfield behind it.

## ðŸ“¸ Features

- Real-time GPU rendering using GLSL fragment shaders
- Backward ray tracing from screen pixels through Schwarzschild geometry
- Accretion disk distortion and photon ring visualization
- Added music to give depth over the simulation
- Public folder has various deep field images, you can try changing the background to see how it looks.
